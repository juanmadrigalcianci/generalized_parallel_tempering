Here we consider the Cauchy  example.
* The file data_cauchy.npy and sig_cauchy.npy contains the data for the Cauchy
* the main file to obtain the results from the tables is ergodic_est_cauchy.py. 

* the file cauchy_plot_log_post.py plots the log-density.
* The file cauchy_integrate.py computes the true mean.


The file base.py contains the RWM,PT,GPT codes.
