# the algorithms are contained in the file base.py. The other python scripts 
# run the examples on the paper. 

# First run the integral circle or integral elliptic. Each file computes the
# exact expected value of the QoI c.f. paper.


# Then run ergodic_est_elliptic.npy (or ergodic_est_circle.npy )
# to run either experiment. Hyper-parameters, such as the number of samples or
# step-size, etc can be found there.
