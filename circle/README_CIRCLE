Here we consider the quarter circle example.

* the main file to obtain the results from the tables and figures is ergodic_est_cirlce_one_run.py.
* The main file to obtain the scatterplots is ergodic_est_circle_plot.py
* the file intergral_circle_all.py plots the density plots for the true density of the circle example. 
* The file true_mean_x_cicle.npy contains the true value of the mean of the x component
* The file true_mean_y_cicle.npy contains the true value of the mean of the y component

The file base.py contains the RWM,PT,GPT codes.
